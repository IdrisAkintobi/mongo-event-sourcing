## What is MESS?


## How to use MESS?

There are three scenarios:

1. clone and forget: as every nodejs application you can edit and change as you like. Not recpmmended old style approach.
2. include in you own project. instal as a module on top of your application, then extend and use it.
3. use ready to go docker images: nothing to do except write your own configuration. You will have any customization opporinuty of other scenarios, but with a ready to go option.
